Hadoop 2.x Components

1. HDFS 
Hadoop Distributed File System :
Its a File System which allows to store the data on local file system in distributed fashion.
HDFS takes care of providing the Virtual environment wherein, it decides to store the data on
cheaper hardware . File is divided in Blockes, each of the block size is 64 MB.
HDFS containes the
1. Name Node (master Node containaing meta iformation as which block is on which data node
2. Data Node- contains the actual data, it stores the file in blocks.

So if the file size is 128MB it will fit 1 block
if its 70 MB again it will fit 2 blocks 1 64 MB and another one of 6 MB, in this case the data which is stored as 6MB in one of the data node will have wastage.

Name nod stores the data with replication factor of 3, which means that at a time it store the data in 3 data nodes, so if at any time 1 of the data node malfunction, data can be fetched from other data node and also it can be repicated in new node.

2. MAP Reduce
Its the Framework which allows the data to be processed parallely.
Input data is divided in Input Splits, considering the inplut split number of mappers are assigned in each of the machines.
Mapper dos the processing of data and gives the output in key valu pair.
This Output is further sorted /consolidated before sending it to reducer.
In reducer the final functinality to filter the data is done and the output is genreated.
Thsi output is in key value pair.
